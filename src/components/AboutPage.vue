  <BaseHeader>About Us</BaseHeader>
  <p>
    We have been building our business since late 2019 in and around the Lancaster area, where we
    are based. we started out in our custom built wood fired pizza trailer, and soon found ourselves
    being asked to provide catering for private events and weddings. This soonbecame an area we
    enjoyed exploring and have since made many long lasting customers, friends and contacts. We have
    built our business by trying to provide high quality food at an affordable level by making each
    event we cater for bespoke and as personalised as we are able to. We have more recently begun to
    find our enquiries have come from much further afieldand as we are mobile, we have enjoyed
    visitimng many locations over the North West such as Lancashire, Cumbria and even as far as
    North Yorkshire.

    In more recent news, we have just invested in a second trailer, again, this has been custom
    builtfor us to be able to offer our own mix of British, American and other BBQ foods. This has
    always been part of our expansion plan from the very start, and after a few small test events,
    our feedback has only encouraged us to believe we made the right decision!
